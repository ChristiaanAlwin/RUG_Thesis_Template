# RUG_Thesis_Template
LaTeX Template for witing a PhD Thesis according to the rules of the University of Groningen

This is all the LaTeX code needed to write a PhD thesis according to the rules of the 
University of Groningen. The Cover can be designed freely with PowerPoint, although the 
thickness of the book has to be adapted to the number of pages of your thesis (current
size is 204 pages). The given slide size corresponds to the printing format of
Copy 76, Zonnelaan 86, 9742 BN Groningen.

Figures should be saved in the designated folder. Source text should be added to dedicated tex-files
in the Tex-folder. The University of Groningeb requires a sepatare sheet of at least
6 defendable propositions. It also requires a short Dutch summary, which should both be included
in the full tesis and as a separate document. Hence, all the different master Tex-files
here. The bibliography should be done with BibTeX and a References-file is provided to adapt.

The current template is optimized to work with Kile 3.1 under Ubuntu 18 LTS and requires the installation
of a complete LaTeX system (sudo apt-get install texlive-full) and the possibility of PDF output.
